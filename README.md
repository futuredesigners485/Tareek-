"Project for developing a Smart and Sustainable Mass Transit System to serve Daily Urban Mobility and enhance Quality of Life in Egyptian Cities."
 
Project Idea
TAREEK is an innovative service project designed to introduce a highly organized and route-defined public transportation network. This system provides an effective solution to traffic congestion by operating scheduled buses that run regularly to designated stations. This ensures a reliable and fast commuting experience for all users, particularly employees, students, and citizens at large.

The project focuses on creating a comprehensive visual and digital system that includes:


•	Building a distinctive Brand Identity: Defining the visual elements (Logo, color palette, and typography) to establish the project's professional presence.

•	Producing Integrated Communication Materials: Developing a full set of promotional assets like (Flyers, social media campaigns, and merchandising items) to ensure wide market reach and public awareness.

•	Designing the Digital and Physical Interface: Creating user-friendly Mobile Application (UI/UX) mockups and a responsive website design, alongside visualizing key physical assets such as the bus livery and station concepts to reflect system readiness.
